- [ ] Language Localizations

 For language localizations you need to translate the value of each key

Example:

```JSON
"Hello": "<p>Hello</p>!",
```

Should be translated to:

```JSON
"Hello": "<p>Â¡Hola!</p>",
```

When you finish completely translating one .JSON file, immediately commit to GitHub, and always put in the commit title:

"Update" + whatever language you just translated + "locale."

DO NOT REMOVE HTML TAGS FROM KEY VALUES!!!
